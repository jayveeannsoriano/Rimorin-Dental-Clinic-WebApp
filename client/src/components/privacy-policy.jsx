          <p className="dc">Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>
          <p className="dc">We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>
